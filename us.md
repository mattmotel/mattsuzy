	<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Ours is a story of a girl from North Carolina and a boy from Massachusetts finally meeting when the time was just right. 
</p><p>
We both attended school at The Savannah College of Art &amp; Design in Georgia without ever meeting. We both moved to the same NYC neighborhood directly after graduation with no idea someone so important was just down the street. We hung out with the same friends, at the same bars, without ever crossing paths. All of this before the most powerful tool of fate serendipitously brought us together... OK Cupid.
</p><p>
Now it's 6 years later and both nothing and everything has changed. We still go on sunday walks, just in a new city. We still debate who's right, it's just always Matt. We still travel, our adventures are just bigger. We still live together, but with an additional tiny, fluffy roommate. We still love each other, but it's more than ever before.</p>

<h3>Big Day Details</h3>
<p>We moved from NYC to Philadelphia in 2015 and fell in love with our new home right away. From the beginning of our engagement we knew it was the perfect place to celebrate our union and introduce our friends and family to a city that means so much to us.
Our venue was selected for it's rich history which began under the original name Bookbinders in 1883. By the 1940s the space had become a staple of Philadelphia and was known throughout the north east as "A martini-soaked mecca for celebrities, tourists, and a clubby crowd of Philadelphians who went there for long, boozy lunches, birthdays and anniversaries"
</p><p>
Today, the space goes by Olde Bar and hosts some of the best parties in Philly! We are thrilled to add our wedding to the story of this beautiful space.</p>
